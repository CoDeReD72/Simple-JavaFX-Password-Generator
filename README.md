# Simple JavaFX Password Generator
 
## Description
This application is a basic example of how a Graphical User Interface (GUI) can be created using *JavaFX* and *CSS* to create a presentable and usable version of the program to a potential user.

The Password Generator currently has a number of factors for generating a password which it must adhere to, such as the following
* Minumum password length (enforced as a minimum of 4)
* Use of numbers in the password
* Use of special characters in the password
* Use of capital letters in the password
